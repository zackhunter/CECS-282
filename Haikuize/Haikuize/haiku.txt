An old silent pond... 
A frog jumps into the pond, 
splash! Silence again. 

A summer river 
being crossed how pleasing with 
sandals in my hands! 

O snail Climb Mount Fuji, But slowly, slowly!

Everything I 
touch with tenderness, alas, 
pricks like a bramble. 

I want to sleep Swat the flies Softly, please.

Light good afternoon 
A whole, tall bottle bounces 
betray by the lake. 

Player, bookkeeper, 
Stronger, able to be pale... 
Shhh! The queen watches
